## 6.2.0

##### Fixed
- Fixes a crash introduced in 6.0.0 when displaying an HTML in-app message using the `BrazeUICompat` module.
- Removed a system call that is known to be slow on older versions of macOS. This resolves the SDK hanging during initialization on Mac Catalyst when running on affected macOS versions.

##### Added
- Adds support for `target` attributes on anchor tags in HTML in-app messages (e.g. `<a href="..." target="_blank"></a>`).
  - Adding the `target` attribute to links will allow them to open in a new webview without dismissing the current in-app message.
  - This behavior can be disabled via the `linkTargetSupport` property of the `BrazeInAppMessageUI.HtmlView.Attributes` struct.
  - See our [Custom HTML in-app messages](https://www.braze.com/docs/user_guide/message_building_by_channel/in-app_messages/traditional/customize/html_in-app_messages/) documentation page for more details.

## 6.1.0

##### Fixed
- Fixes an issue that led to disproportionately large close buttons on in-app messages when the user has set a large font size in the device settings.
- Fixes an issue that would lock the screen in a specific orientation after the dismissal of an in-app message customized to be presented in that orientation.
  - This issue only impacted iOS 16.0+ devices.

##### Added
- Adds new versions of `setCustomAttribute` to the User object to support [nested custom attributes][nca-docs].
  - Renames `User.setCustomAttributeArray(key: String, array: [String]?)` to `setCustomAttribute(â€¦)` to align it with other custom attribute setters, and adds "string" to the `addTo` and `removeFrom` attribute array methods to clarify which custom attributes they're used for.

## 6.0.0

##### Breaking
- The in-app message data models sent to [`BrazeInAppMessagePresenter.present(message:)`](https://braze-inc.github.io/braze-swift-sdk/documentation/brazekit/brazeinappmessagepresenter/present(message:)) now contain remote asset URLs. Previously, these data models would contain local asset URLs.
  - This change is only breaking in two situations:
    - When implementing a custom `BrazeInAppMessagePresenter`.
    - When relying on asset URLs being local in the message provided by [`BrazeInAppMessageUIDelegate.inAppMessage(_:displayChoiceForMessage:)`](https://braze-inc.github.io/braze-swift-sdk/documentation/brazeui/brazeinappmessageuidelegate/inappmessage(_:displaychoiceformessage:)-9w1nb)
  - The in-app message data models available from the other [`BrazeInAppMessageUIDelegate`](https://braze-inc.github.io/braze-swift-sdk/documentation/brazeui/brazeinappmessageuidelegate) methods remain unchanged and contain local asset URLs.

##### Added
- The in-app message context now provides two additional methods:
  - [`getLocalAssets(urls:destinationURL:completionHandler:)`](https://braze-inc.github.io/braze-swift-sdk/documentation/brazekit/braze/inappmessageraw/context-swift.class/getlocalassets(urls:destinationurl:completionhandler:)): Retrieves the local assets associated with the given remote asset URLs.
  - [`withLocalAssets(message:destinationURL:completionHandler:)`](https://braze-inc.github.io/braze-swift-sdk/documentation/brazekit/braze/inappmessageraw/context-swift.class/withlocalassets(message:destinationurl:completionhandler:)): Returns a modified in-app message with all remote asset URLs replaced with local ones.

## 5.14.0

##### Fixed
- VoiceOver now correctly focuses on in-app message views when they are presented.
- Fixes an issue causing in-app messages with re-eligibility disabled to display multiple times under certain conditions.
- Fixes an issue where modal and full in-app message headers were truncated on devices running iOS versions lower than 16 when displaying non-ASCII characters.
- The dynamic variant of `BrazeUI.framework` in the release artifact `braze-swift-sdk-prebuilt.zip` is now an actual dynamic framework. Previously, this specific framework was mistakenly distributed as a static framework.

##### Added
- Adds the `BrazeSDKAuthDelegate` protocol as a separate protocol from `BrazeDelegate`, allowing for more flexible integrations.
  - Apps implementing `BrazeDelegate.braze(_:sdkAuthenticationFailedWithError:)` should migrate to use `BrazeSDKAuthDelegate` and remove the old implementation. The `BrazeDelegate` method will be removed in a future major release.

## 5.13.0

##### Fixed
- Fixes an issue where the SDK would automatically track body clicks on non-legacy HTML in-app messages.

##### Added
- Adds the synchronous `deviceId` property on the Braze instance.
  - `deviceId(queue:completion:)` is now deprecated.
  - `deviceId() async` is now deprecated.
- Adds the `automaticBodyClicks` property to the HTML in-app message view attributes. This property can be used to enable automatic body clicks tracking on non-legacy HTML in-app messages.
  - This property is `false` by default.
  - This property is ignored for legacy HTML in-app messages.

## 5.12.0

> Starting with this release, this SDK will use [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/).

##### Added
- Adds `json()` and `decoding(json:)` public methods to the Feature Flag model object for JSON encoding/decoding.

## 5.11.2

##### Fixed
- Fixes a crash occurring when the SDK is configured with a flush interval of `0` and network connectivity is poor.

## 5.11.1

##### Fixed
- Fixes an issue preventing the correct calculation of the delay when retrying failed requests. This led to a more aggressive retry schedule than intended.
- Improves the performance of Live Activity tracking by de-duping push token tag requests.
- Fixes an issue in `logClick(using:)` where it would incorrectly open the `url` field in addition to logging a click for metrics. It now only logs a click for metrics.
  - This applies to the associated APIs for content cards, in-app messages, and news feed cards.
  - It is still recommended to use the associated `Context` object to log interactions instead of these APIs.

##### Added
- Adds [`BrazeKit.overrideResourceBundle`] and [`BrazeUI.overrideResourceBundle`] to allow for custom resource bundles to be used by the SDK.
  - This feature is useful when your setup prevents you from using the default resource bundle (e.g. Tuist).

[`BrazeKit.overrideResourceBundle`]: https://braze-inc.github.io/braze-swift-sdk/documentation/brazekit/overrideresourcebundle
[`BrazeUI.overrideResourceBundle`]: https://braze-inc.github.io/braze-swift-sdk/documentation/brazeui/overrideresourcebundle/

## 5.11.0

##### Added
- Adds support for [Live Activities](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/activitykit/displaying-live-data-with-live-activities) via the `liveActivities` module on the Braze instance.
  - This feature provides the following new methods for tracking and managing Live Activities with the Braze push server:
    - `launchActivity(pushTokenTag:activity:)`
    - `resumeActivities(ofType:)`
  - This feature requires iOS 16.1 and up.
  - To learn how to integrate this feature, refer to the [setup tutorial](https://braze-inc.github.io/braze-swift-sdk/tutorials/braze/b4-live-activities/).
- Adds logic to re-synchronize Content Cards on SDK version changes.
- Adds provisional support for Xcode 14.3 Beta via the [`braze-inc/braze-swift-sdk-xcode-14-3-preview`](https://github.com/braze-inc/braze-swift-sdk-xcode-14-3-preview) repository.

## 5.10.1

##### Changed
- Dynamic versions of the prebuilt xcframeworks are now available in the `braze-swift-sdk-prebuilt.zip` release artifact.

## 5.10.0

##### Fixed
- Fixes an issue where test content cards were removed before their expiration date.
- Fixes an issue in `BrazeUICompat` where the status bar appearance wasn't restored to its original state after dismissing a full in-app message.
- Fixes an issue when decoding notification payloads where some valid boolean values weren't correctly parsed.

##### Changed
- In-app modal and full-screen messages are now rendered with `UITextView`, which better supports large amounts of text and extended UTF code points.

## 5.9.1

##### Fixed
- Fixes an issue preventing local expired content cards from being removed.
- Fixes a behavior that could lead to background tasks extending beyond the expected time limit with inconsistent network connectivity.

##### Added
- Adds `logImpression(using:)` and `logClick(buttonId:using:)` to news feed cards.

## 5.9.0

##### Breaking
- Raises the minimum deployment target to iOS 11.0 and tvOS 11.0.
- Raises the Xcode version to 14.1 (14B47b).

##### Fixed
- Fixes an issue where the post-click webview would close automatically in some cases.
- Fixes a behavior where the current user messaging data would not be directly available after initializing the SDK or calling `changeUser(userId:)`.
- Fixes an issue preventing News Feed data models from being available offline.
- Fixes an issue where the release binaries could emit warnings when generating dSYMs.

##### Changed
- SwiftPM and CocoaPods now use the same release assets.

##### Added
- Adds support for the upcoming Braze Feature Flags product.
- Adds the `braze-swift-sdk-prebuilt.zip` archive to the release assets.
  - This archive contains the prebuilt xcframeworks and their associated resource bundles.
  - The content of this archive can be used to manually integrate the SDK.
- Adds the `Examples-Manual.xcodeproj` showcasing how to integrate the SDK using the prebuilt release assets.
- Adds support for Mac Catalyst for example applications, available at [Support/Examples/](./Support/Examples/README.md)
- Adds support to convert from `Data` into an in-app message, content card, or news feed card via `decoding(json:)`.

## 5.8.1

##### Fixed
- Fixes a conflict with the shared instance of [`ProcessInfo`], allowing low power mode notifications to trigger correctly.

##### Changed
- Renames the `BrazeLocation` class to `BrazeLocationProvider` to avoid shadowing the module of the same name ([SR-14195](https://bugs.swift.org/browse/SR-14195)).

[`ProcessInfo`]: https://developer.apple.com/documentation/foundation/processinfo

## 5.8.0

To help migrate your app from the Appboy-iOS-SDK to our Swift SDK, this release includes the `Appboy-iOS-SDK` [migration guide]:
- Follow step-by-step instructions to migrate each feature to the new APIs.
- Includes instructions for a minimal migration scenario via our compatibility libraries.

##### Added
- Adds compatibility libraries `BrazeKitCompat` and `BrazeUICompat`:
  - Provides all the old APIs from `Appboy-iOS-SDK` to easily start migrating to the Swift SDK.
  - See the [migration guide] for more details.
- Adds support for [News Feed](https://www.braze.com/docs/user_guide/engagement_tools/news_feed) data models and analytics.
  - News Feed UI is not supported by the Swift SDK. See the [migration guide] for instructions on using the compatibility UI.

[migration guide]: https://braze-inc.github.io/braze-swift-sdk/documentation/braze/appboy-migration-guide

## 5.7.0

##### Fixed
- Fixes an issue where modal image in-app messages would not respect the aspect ratio of the image when the height of the image is larger than its width.

##### Changed
- Changes modal, modal image, full, and full image in-app message view attributes to use the `ViewDimension` type for their `minWidth`, `maxWidth` and `maxHeight` attributes.
  - The `ViewDimension` type enables providing different values for regular and large size-classes.

##### Added
- Adds a configuration to use a randomly generated UUID instead of IDFV as the device ID: [`useUUIDAsDeviceId`](https://braze-inc.github.io/braze-swift-sdk/documentation/brazekit/braze/configuration-swift.class/useuuidasdeviceid).
  - This configuration defaults to `false`. To opt in to this feature, set this value to `true`.
  - Enabling this value will only affect new devices. Existing devices will use the device identifier that was previously registered.

## 5.6.4

##### Fixed
- Fixes an issue preventing the execution of `BrazeDelegate` methods when setting the delegate using Objective-C.
- Fixes an issue where triggering an in-app message twice with the same event did not place the message on the in-app message stack under certain conditions.

##### Added
- Adds the public `id` field to `Braze.InAppMessage.Data`.
- Adds `logImpression(using:)` and `logClick(buttonId:using:)` to both in-app messages and content cards, and adds `logDismissed(using:)` to content cards.
  - It is recommended to continue using the associated `Context` to log impressions, clicks, and dismissals for the majority of use cases.
- Adds Swift concurrency to support async/await versions of the following public methods. These methods can be used as alternatives to their corresponding counterparts that use completion handlers:
  - [`Braze.User.id()`]
  - [`Braze.deviceId()`]
  - [`ContentCards.requestRefresh()`]
  - [`ContentCards.cardsStream`] as an alternative to [`ContentCards.subscribeToUpdates(_:)`]

## 5.6.3

##### Fixed
- Fixes the `InAppMessageRaw` to `InAppMessage` conversion to properly take into account the `extras` dictionary and the `duration`.
- Fixes an issue preventing the execution of the [`braze(_:sdkAuthenticationFailedWithError:)`](https://braze-inc.github.io/braze-swift-sdk/documentation/brazekit/brazedelegate/braze(_:sdkauthenticationfailedwitherror:)-505pz) delegate method in case of an authentication error.
